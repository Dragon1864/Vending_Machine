# Vending_Machine
A vending machine using verilog
Here I am using the concept of state machine to create a vending machine using the verilog HDL language and implement it on FPGA board.
Here the machine initially takes three things as input which are to chose the size of the drink based on the amount of money inserted.
each currency has a different state assigned to it.
there are Small, Medium and Large sizes available.
After the money is inserted there are four optiions to choose from.
Americano
Cappuccino
Espresso
Fresh Brew
[these names were choosen as the first letter is easy to display on BCD].
